Follow this workflow precisely. Do not deviate.
1. **Search for Official Documentation**:
    - Use the `search` tool to locate the official Google Cloud documentation page that lists all available custom Organization Policy constraints for the product '{user:product_name}'.
    - You MUST ensure that the documentation page you find is up-to-date and official.
2. **Read the Documentation**:
    - Use the `read_webpage` tool to access and extract the content from the most relevant documentation page.
    - The documentation must contain all available constraints for custom Organization Policies, including the constraint name, description, and any other relevant details.
3. **Identify All Constraints**:
    - Carefully read through the webpage content and identify **every single available custom constraint**.
    - Each constraint must be documented with the following details:
        - **Constraint Name**
        - **Display Name** (A human-readable title for the constraint)
        - **Description** (A detailed description of the constraint)
4. **Generate Terraform Module Block**:
    - For each constraint you identify, you MUST generate a complete, valid Terraform module block in the correct format, as outlined below:
        - **Terraform Module Format** (HCL Syntax):
        ```terraform
        module "org_policy_<constraint_name>" {{
          source      = "terraform-google-modules/org-policy/google"
          constraint  = "customConstraints/<constraint_name>"

        - Make sure you replace `<constraint_name>`, `<constraint_display_name>`, `<constraint_description>`, and `<constraint_expression_here>` with actual data.
        - The expression block (`<<CEL ... CEL`) should contain the **CEL (Common Expression Language)** for that constraint.
5. **Combine Terraform Modules**:
    - Once you have generated the Terraform module block for each constraint, combine all of them into a single string.
    - Each module block MUST be separated by a file delimiter line, like this:
      ```
      === org_policy_<constraint_name>.tf ===
      ```
6. **Final Output**:
    - Your final output MUST be a single **multi-file string** that includes all the Terraform module blocks.
    - **Do not** add any conversational text or explanations. Only include the generated Terraform blocks, separated by file delimiter lines.
    - Ensure that each block is in valid HCL syntax and corresponds to a unique custom Organization Policy constraint.

    """Instructions for saving custom Organization Policies as individual Terraform `.tf` files and pushing them to GitHub."""

Your task is to take the provided multi-file Terraform string, save each custom Organization Policy to its own individual `.tf` file using the `write_org_policy_tf` tool, and then push the generated `.tf` files to a GitHub repository's output folder.
 
Follow this workflow step-by-step:
 
### 1. **Extract Individual Terraform Modules**:
   - The input you will receive is a **multi-file Terraform string**. This string contains one or more Terraform module blocks, each corresponding to a custom Organization Policy.
   - Each module block will be separated by a delimiter in the following format:
     ```
     === <filename>.tf ===
     <Terraform module content>
     === <next_filename>.tf ===
     ```
     The filenames (e.g., `org_policy_<constraint_name>.tf`) are specified within the delimiters, and each block represents a single `.tf` file.
 
### 2. **Parse and Identify File Delimiters**:
   - Use the regular expression (`=== filename.tf ===`) to identify the filenames and extract the associated Terraform module content.
   - For each delimiter, extract the content between the delimiter and save it to the corresponding file.
     - Example: If the delimiter is `=== org_policy_<constraint_name>.tf ===`, the content between this delimiter should be written to `org_policy_<constraint_name>.tf`.
 
### 3. **Write Terraform Files**:
   - Use the `write_org_policy_tf` tool to save each Terraform module block into its respective `.tf` file.
   - The `multi_file_tf_string` parameter will contain the entire input with delimiters separating the different files.
   - For each extracted module block:
     - Write the content to a file in the `output/org_policies_tf` directory.
     - Ensure the directory exists and create it if necessary. If the directory doesn't exist, create it (`os.makedirs(output_dir)`).
 
### 4. **Push Files to GitHub**:
   - Once all `.tf` files have been saved, the next step is to push them to the GitHub repository.
   - Use the GitHub API or GitHub Actions to push the files to the desired repository and directory (e.g., the `output/org_policies_tf/` folder).
   - Ensure the files are committed with appropriate messages, such as: `"Add custom organization policies for <product_name>"`.
 
### 5. **Handling Errors and Success**:
   - If there are no valid module blocks found in the input (i.e., the string doesn't contain any delimiters or valid Terraform content), return an error message:
     - `{"status": "error", "message": "No valid Terraform file blocks were found in the input."}`
   - If the writing process completes successfully for all files, return a success message:
     - `{"status": "complete", "message": "SUCCESS: Wrote '<filename>'."}`
   - If any error occurs during the file writing process (e.g., permission issues or invalid content), return the error message with the filename and specific error:
     - `{"status": "error", "message": "FAILURE: Could not write file '<filename>'. Error: <error_message>"}`
   - If there is an issue with pushing the files to GitHub, return an error message:
     - `{"status": "error", "message": "FAILURE: Could not push files to GitHub. Error: <error_message>"}`
 
### 6. **Directory Structure**:
   - All `.tf` files must be written to the directory:
     ```
     output/org_policies_tf/
     ```
   - The files should be named according to the constraint they correspond to, using the format: `org_policy_<constraint_name>.tf`.
   - After writing, push these files to the `output/org_policies_tf/` directory on GitHub.
 
### 7. **Final Check**:
   - After the writing and GitHub push processes, ensure that all `.tf` files are saved correctly in the specified directory and pushed to GitHub.
   - If there are any issues during the process, log them and ensure that the tool’s output clearly reflects the result of each file operation (both for saving and pushing to GitHub).
 
### Expected Output:
   - A set of `.tf` files, each corresponding to a custom Organization Policy constraint, saved in the `output/org_policies_tf/` directory and pushed to GitHub.
   - The result returned by `write_org_policy_tf` should indicate the status of the file writing operation (either `complete` or `error`), along with relevant success or failure messages.
   - The result of pushing to GitHub should indicate whether the push was successful or not, along with the commit message and status.
