Overview of the Multi-Agent System Workflow

The system is designed to facilitate a structured product discovery process. It involves multiple specialized agents, each responsible for assessing specific aspects of a product. These agents work in parallel, and their findings are synthesized into a comprehensive report. The workflow is orchestrated by a central agent, ensuring a systematic and iterative process.

Key Components and Their Roles

Product Overview Agent
	Function: return_instructions_product_overview
	Role: Assesses product features, limitations, pricing, and identifies gaps or limitations in Preview and GA (General Availability) features.

Infrastructure Agent

	Function: return_instructions_discovery_infrastructure
	Role: Evaluates the product's infrastructure capabilities, including Terraform support, REST API features, gcloud functionalities, and regional/multi-regional support.

Security Agent

	Function: return_instructions_discovery_security
	Role: Focuses on security features such as encryption (at rest and in transit), TLS, CMEK, IAM, data residency, VPC-SC, and custom security policies.

Networking Agent

	Function: return_instructions_discovery_networking
	Role: Analyzes networking features like Private Service Connect, Private Google Access, firewalls, and interconnects, identifying any gaps or limitations.
Critic Agent

	Function: return_instructions_recritic
	Role: Reviews and critiques the findings of the other agents. It ensures the accuracy and completeness of the information, identifies hallucinations, and synthesizes the findings into a structured product assessment template. The output includes:
	- Suitability assessment areas with ratings and observations.
	- Areas requiring further discovery.
	- Markdown-based structured output with links and recommendations.

Discovery Orchestrator

	Function: return_instructions_discovery_orchestrator
	Role: Acts as the central orchestrator for the discovery process. It follows a strict workflow:
		- Calls the ResearchAndCritiqueAgent tool for initial research.
		- Presents the draft report to the user.
		- Seeks user approval or feedback.
		- Publishes the approved report to Confluence or incorporates feedback and restarts the process.

Workflow Highlights
	- Parallel Execution: The system leverages multiple agents working in parallel to cover different aspects of product discovery.
	- Iterative Feedback Loop: The orchestrator ensures that user feedback is incorporated iteratively, refining the report until approval.
	- Structured Output: The critic agent synthesizes findings into a structured format, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness.
	- Automation and Human Oversight: While the process is largely automated, it includes checkpoints for human review and approval.
